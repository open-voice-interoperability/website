The growth of the digital economy has led in recent years to the introduction of numerous regulations, laws, and guidelines regarding data use and consumer data protection. Within this long list of consumer data protection legislation and regulation, legal analysts point to two as most important to current European and North American practice: the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) of the European Union and the GDPR-inspired California Consumer Protection Act (CCPA).



Voice assistance began to emerge as an important consumer technology at the same time GDPR and CCPA were in their initial development. Although GDPR and CCPA are directly relevant to the use of this technology, voice assistance brings with it a number new privacy and consumer data use issues.



For these reasons, the Technical Committee of the Open Voice Network, an open source community of the Linux Foundation dedicated to standards development for voice assistance, formed last year a Work Group chartered to develop, in accord with current regulation and legislation, privacy guidelines specific to voice assistance.



The Open Voice Network is requesting public comment on Version 1.0 of these guidelines, “Privacy Guidelines and Capabilities Unique to Voice.”

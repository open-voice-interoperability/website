To make voice assistance worthy of user trust, the Open Voice Network (OVON) is pursuing technical standards development in four areas: 1) voice-agent-to-voice-agent interoperability, 2) voice-based findability and discoverability, 3) user privacy specific to voice, and 4) data security specific to voice. We are also researching the need for technical standards in synthetic voice development and identification and voice-based authentication.  

## Interoperability Initiative

The Open Voice Network Interoperability Initiative is led by the OVON Architecture Work Group, which reports to the OVON Technical Steering Committee. 

### Core Question:

> How might voice agents of different platforms or technical parentage share dialogs, data, context, and controls?

To help answer this question, the Open Voice Network seeks the advice and expertise of speech scientists, voice developers, and voice practitioners—those who can collaboratively address the why, the what, and the how. The Interoperability Initiative team meets every Tuesday at 17:00 CET (08:00 Pacific).

## Voice Registry System (VRS) Initiative

The Open Voice Network Voice Registry System Initiative seeks to address the needs of voice-based destination findability and discoverability that will emerge in a worldwide voice web. This is the task of the OVON VRS Work Group, which reports to the OVON Technical Steering Committee.

### Core Questions:

> How might voice users confidently find and discover preferred voice agent/application destinations in a worldwide voice web? 
> <br></br>
> How might organizations protect their brand names and brand experiences in a worldwide voice web? 

The VRS Work Group meets every other Thursday at 17:00 CET (08:00 Pacific).

## User Privacy Initiative

The Open Voice Network User Privacy Initiative is led by the OVON Privacy and Security Work Group, which reports to the OVON Technical Steering Committee.

### Core Questions:

> How might current and envisioned voice technologies threaten individual privacy and create personal and institutional harm?
> <br></br>
> How might practitioners of voice technology (from developers to organizations) be guided to respect established privacy rights and earn constituent trust?
> <br></br>
> How might commercial users of voice protect their data and that of their constituents?

The Open Voice Network Privacy and Security Work Group is learning how user privacy is affected by the current voice environment and working towards suggestions on how data from users of voice technology can stay protected. The Privacy and Security Work Group meets every Tuesday at 16:00 CET (07:00 Pacific).

## Voice-Data Security Initiative

The Open Voice Network Data Security Initiative is led by the OVON Privacy and Security Work Group, which reports to the OVON Technical Steering Committee. 

### Core Questions:

> What threats to organizational data security currently exist (and will emerge) with the emergent adoption of voice technology?
> <br></br>
> What steps must organizational security officers now take?
> <br></br>
> Is there research now in development which will guide and inform security officers for the future world of voice?

The Open Voice Network Privacy and Security Work Group is learning how user privacy is affected by the current voice environment and working towards suggestions on how data from users of voice technology can stay protected. The Privacy and Security Work Group meets every Tuesday at 16:00 CET (07:00 Pacific).

## Synthetic Voice Study Group

The Open Voice Network Synthetic Voice Study Initiative is led by the OVON Synthetic Voice Study Group, which reports to the OVON Technical Steering Committee.

### Core Questions:

> What is the operative definition of Synthetic Voice? How is it created?
> <br></br>
> What are the benefits and risks of Synthetic Voice? Who are the primary constituents and stakeholders of Synthetic Voice?
> <br></br>
> What technical standards should be created for the benefit of Synthetic Voice creators, participants, and consumers? 

The Synthetic Voice Study Group meets monthly on Wednesdays at 17:00 CET (08:00 Pacific).

## Authentication Study Group

The Open Voice Network Authentication Study Initiative is led by the OVON Authentication Study Group, which reports to the OVON Technical Steering Committee.

### Core Questions:

> What is the current state of password-free biometric authentication? What might voice learn from other biometric authentication processes?
> <br></br>
> For consumers and developers of voice experiences and services, what is a best-case (UX and security) authentication process?
> <br></br>
> What technical standards should be created for the benefit of voice-centric authentication creators, participants, and consumers?

The Authentication Study Group meets bi-weekly on Fridays at 18:00 CET (09:00 Pacific).

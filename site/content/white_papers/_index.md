  The Communities and Work Groups of the Open Voice Network are excited to
  present their recently published white papers to the general public. Topics
  range from privacy, ethical use, synthetic voice, education, and more. Below
  you will find a link to each white paper along with a link to each paperâ€™s
  feedback form. We look forward to hearing your thoughts, questions, and
  criticisms on each publication.

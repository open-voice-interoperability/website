  heading: The importance of standards-based voice assistance.
  text: >-
    Voice will soon become a common interface for every digital device. For consumer-facing industries, voice will significantly re-shape customer relationships and lift corporate productivity, accessibility, and inclusion. But what started as the world’s fastest adopted consumer technology may fall well short of its potential for acceptance and enterprise value. **Research points to a "trust gap" that raises critical questions of privacy, data security, ease of use, brand protection, interoperability, and equal and unbiased access for individual and organizational users alike.**
    <br><br>
    A proven way to close the trust gap – one pursued in the early days of other technologies – is through the communal development and adoption of standards and usage guidelines.
    <br><br>
    Welcome to the Open Voice Network.  Voice worthy of user trust.

  text: >-
    Artificial intelligence-enabled voice assistance will soon be a primary
    interface to the internet, mobile apps, smart home and factories, and
    enterprise applications. Voice assistance is the fastest-adopted consumer
    technology ever. Yet today's consumers are showing increased hesitation to
    venture into new usage – especially outside of today's proprietary
    platforms. As we enter a multi-platform voice world, this raises critical
    questions of open connection, equal access, and data privacy for today's
    consumers and enterprises.

      Open, objective, and ethical. The OVN is a non-profit organization that
      will seek – in open, rigorous exploration – to develop standards that
      bring the most to the many. Where no one entity unfairly benefits from any
      proposed standards or recommended guidelines.

      Results focused. We are milestone-driven and outcome-based. And we know
      that standards development and governing body approval has merit only if
      it is followed by broad industry adoption and implementation.

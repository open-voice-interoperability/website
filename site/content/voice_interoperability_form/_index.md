subtitle: The Open Voice Network (OVN) solicits presentation proposals for an online workshop on the interoperability of voice applications.
description: >-
  <strong>Perceived problem:</strong> voice applications on different platforms cannot easily
  communicate and share data.  For example, a shopping application on platform
  A cannot invoke a payment application on platform B, provide it with billing information, and then receive results of the payment application before continuing with fulfilment processing.  
  <br><br>
  <strong>Workshop goal:</strong>  to explore various approaches for implementing
  interoperability of voice applications within and across platforms.
  <br><br>
  Specifically, we solicit descriptions for
  <br><br>
   • How one voice application invokes another voice application<br>
   • How control is passed among cooperating voice applications<br>
   • How data and context is shared among cooperating voice applications<br>
   • Other topics related to interoperating voice applications<br>
  <br><br>
  The Open Voice Network will use knowledge from this workshop to assist it in
  designing a standards-based approach to voice application interoperability.
  <br><br>
  Tentative schedule:
  <br><br>
  <strong>30 April 2021:</strong>   Proposal submittal deadline<br>
  <strong>21 May 2021:</strong>    Presenters are announced, and workshop agenda published.<br>
  <strong>15-17 June 2021:</strong>   Virtual workshop using video conferencing technology.<br>
  No attendance fee.<br>
  Two hours per day (7:00 - 9:00 a.m. Pacific time). The conference will be
  recorded and available for access by the public.<br>

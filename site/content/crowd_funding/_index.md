    textHTML: >-
      As one of its directed funds and open source communities, the Open Voice
      Network is excited to announce the establishment of a crowdfunding
      platform for our organization on behalf of The Linux Foundation. This
      development is in direct response to the ongoing growth of the Open Voice
      Network and our desire to expand the reach of our organization.
      Crowd-sourced funds will be directly invested in OVON standards research,
      demo development, and publication.
  - heading: Why Should You Donate
    textHTML: >-
      The Open Voice Network is devoted to the development of technical
      standards and usage guidelines that will make voice worthy of user
      trust—open, standards based, interoperable, privacy minded, and data
      protected. <br></br> <blockquote><cite> "Would you prefer to shape the
      future of voice or passively be shaped by it? If you prefer the former,
      the Open Voice Network is the place for you. Please join us." <br></br>Jon
      Stine, Executive Director of the Open Voice Network </cite></blockquote>

      By choosing to participate in our crowdfunding efforts, you will have a
      significant impact on the future of voice through the broadening of our
      reach as an organization, as well as through the investments of future
      standards developments. Organizations around the world contribute to Linux
      Foundation projects like the Open Voice Network due to their desire to
      take an active role in supporting the growth and development of voice
      technologies and the standards and guidelines around them—and now, you can
      too.

    heading: Support the Work of the Open Voice Network
    textHTML: >-
      AI-enabled voice assistance is reshaping digital usage for consumers and
      organizations across the world. However, today’s AI-voice environment is
      like the early, pre-standards days of the internet—no recognized registry
      of destination or dispatch names, and no assured way for consumers to find
      companies or brands. In such an environment, there’s a critical need for
      leaders (enterprise users and developers alike) to join together and
      develop the standards that will allow this transformative technology to
      reach its full, open, potential.

      Standards that encourage use and growth. Standards that enable competitive
      differentiation. Standards that will give everyone their voice. This is
      the reason for the Open Voice Network—a non-profit association of
      enterprises, tech firms, developers, and researchers who believe that
      conversational AI will deliver the most to the most when it is standards
      based, open, accessible to all, data protected, and interoperable.

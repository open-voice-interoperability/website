eventSubTitle: Moderated by Oita Coleman
eventDescription: >-
  <p>Voices can now be cloned and “synthesized;” well-recognized voices can be
  taken apart and re-assembled to speak new scripts and even new languages.
  Gamers who assume new online identities with avatars can also obtain a new,
  unique, human-like voice – created, uniquely, to a desired tone, range, and
  accent.</p><p>All this opens new worlds of data analysis, of potentially
  significant benefits and risks to business and society. It also opens new
  areas of opportunity for cybercriminals, and new data security concerns for
  enterprise leaders.</p><p><a

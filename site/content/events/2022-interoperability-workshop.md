      What I do: I elicit your organization's deeply-held tacit knowledge and
      enable you to disseminate that knowledge within your staff, and/or use it
      to inform the development of intelligent algorithms ("AI"). Multilingual
      and multicultural, I have worked with executives from around the world in
      pursuit of organizational performance and effectiveness, digital
      transformation, and satisfaction of all internal and external
      stakeholders. In particular, for 20 years this work was predominantly
      conducted in French.

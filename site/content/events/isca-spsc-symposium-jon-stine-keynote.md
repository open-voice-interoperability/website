eventTitle: ISCA SPSC Symposium
eventSubTitle: 2nd Symposium on Security and Privacy in Speech Communication
eventDescription: >-
  Speech and voice are media through which we express ourselves. Speech
  communication can be used to command virtual assistants, to transport emotion
  or to identify oneself. How can we strengthen security and privacy for speech
  representation types in user-centric human/machine
  interaction?<br></br>Interdisciplinary exchange is in high demand. The need to
  better understand and develop user-centric security solutions and privacy
  safeguard in speech communication is of growing importance for commercial,
  forensic, and government applications. The SPSC Symposium is a platform to
  seek better designed services and products as well as better informed policy
  papers for legislators and governance. The symposium is organized by the ISCA
  SPSC special interest group and the VoicePrivacy Challenge Team.<br></br><a

  independent voice developers and strategists—where and how does voice create
  quantifiable and sustainable value? Where and how will an investment in voice
  bring greater returns than an investment in something else?</p><p>These and
  other questions are the topics of a half-day, pre-conference bootcamp
  experience, led by Hans van Dam, CEO of the Conversation Design Institute
  (CDI), Jon Stine, Executive Director of the Open Voice Network (OVON), and a
  selection of speakers and mentors from leading global brands and technology

eventDescription: >-
  <p>The possibilities for voice-enabled AI are endless, and we’re seeing the
  future unfold right before our eyes. However, when we discuss ethics,
  interoperability, privacy, or any number of voice-related topics, there exists
  one driving force that leads to a core question—where’s the money?</p><p>The
  Open Voice Network is excited to launch our latest webinar series,
  <strong>Show Me the Money – Monetizing Voice.</strong> This three-part series
  will explore the financial component of the growing voice industry, namely
  where money will be found with and through voice. We’ll discuss how brands and
  agencies can justify the investment in voice with concrete examples of
  enterprise, B2B, and B2C use cases that focus on revenue, operational
  efficiency, and cost reduction.</p><p>Join us on <strong>29 June, 2022 at 3PM
  ET</strong> for Part 1 of the series, featuring an expert panel composed of
  prominent members of the voice community—Shyamala Prayaga, Roger Kibbe, Ron
  Jaworski, Nick Godfrey, and Donald Buckley.</p><p>We hope to inform attendees
  on the current landscape in voice as it pertains to investing, while also
  providing a glimpse into the future of how organizations will utilize voice to
  increase cash flow and redefine their business.</p><p><a target="_blank"

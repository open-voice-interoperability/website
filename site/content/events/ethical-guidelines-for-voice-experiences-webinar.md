  white paper was written for enterprises and organizations who are actively
  utilizing voice technologies or plan to in the future. The Task Force set out
  to answer a multitude of questions tied to human interactions with voice,
  including: <i>What are voice-specific issues of ethical and moral concern, and
  how do we define them? What are the values to be promoted for ethical
  interaction with voice technology? What are the rights to be respected for
  successful, ethical voice experiences?</i> and many more. The answers to these
  questions were used to construct a voice-specific ethical framework composed
  of six foundational principles of ethics—compliance, transparency,
  inclusivity, privacy protection, accountability, and sustainability.</p><p><a

  - bio: "When I was a kid, I used to take apart all of the electronics in the house to see what was inside. Problem is, I didn't know how to put them back together. Remote controls, trashed, vacuum cleaners, thrashed. It was then that I realized I was not going to be an engineer, but I knew that I wanted to work in technology. From there I have held different roles and started companies that have allowed me to explore technology and creativity. Skilled Creative is my latest venture, where we help our partners explore how emerging technologies like VOICE can impact their business and marketing strategies. We've worked with PepsiCo, Pfizer, Wall Street Journal, Entertainment Weekly, All Recipes, Simon & Schuster, ABI-INBEV, and a number of other great brands. \rOur Skills: Voice Experiences (Alexa/Google), Mobile AR, Computer Vision, Data Visualizations, Projection Mapping, Thermal Imaging, Robotics, RFID, Data driven experiential, and Emerging technology strategy"

      yet inherently social – Glass would be. His goal is to help people use
      Glass to find experiences that can be achieved in no other way – whether
      it's how they interact, play games, or just record precious moments in
      time with their families.

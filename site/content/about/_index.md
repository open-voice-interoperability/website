      The Open Voice Network (OVON) seeks to make voice technology worthy of
      user trust—a task of critical importance as voice emerges as a primary,
      multi-device portal to the digital and IOT worlds, and as independent,
      specialist voice assistants take their place next to general purpose
      platforms.
  - heading: Mission

    text: >-
      The Open Voice Network will achieve its vision through the communal
      development and adoption of industry standards and usage guidelines,
      industry education and advocacy initiatives, and the development and
      documentation of voice-centric value propositions.

      <p>The Open Voice Network is guided by four values. It seeks a world of
      voice technology that</p> <ol>
        <li>is worthy of user trust;</li>
        <li> enables user, ecosystem, and architectural choice;</li>
        <li>is inclusive and accessible;</li>
        <li>is open in software and hardware, with standards serving as a foundation for commercial differentiation.</li>
      </ol>

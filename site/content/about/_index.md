      The Open Voice Network (OVN) is dedicated to making voice assistance
      worthy of user trust—especially for a future of voice assistance that will
      be multi-platform, multi-device, multi-modal, and multi-use.

      The Open Voice Network will achieve its vision through the development and
      proposal of standards to the global voice industry. We envision standards
      that enable trust-worthy accessibility, identification and authentication,
      data privacy, and interoperability.

It is:\n(1) user-centric, reflecting the interests of enterprises, media and marketers, designers and developers, as well as platforms;  \n(2)\_pragmatic, based in today’s realities and tomorrow’s feasibilities; \n(3) committed to open, objective, and ethical decision-making, where no one entity unfairly benefits;  \n(4) focused on results."

      The Open Voice Network emerged from 2016-2018 research on the potential of
      AI-enabled voice assistance conducted by the Massachusetts Institute of
      Technology (MIT) Auto-ID Laboratory, Capgemini Consulting, and the Intel
      Corporation.   In late 2018, seed funding was provided to initiate
      research into voice assistance technologies and potential standards, and
      to develop The Open Voice Network.

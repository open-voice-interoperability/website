      <p>The Open Voice Network emerged from 2016-2018 research on the potential of
      AI-enabled voice assistance conducted by the Massachusetts Institute of
      Technology (MIT) Auto-ID Laboratory, Capgemini Consulting, and the Intel
      Corporation.   In late 2018, seed funding was provided to initiate
      research into voice assistance technologies and potential standards, and
      to develop The Open Voice Network.</p>

      <p>The Open Voice Network is a directed fund project of The Linux Foundation.</p>

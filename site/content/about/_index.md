      multi-platform, multi-device, multi-modal, and multi-use.

      AI-enabled voice assistance conducted by the Massachusetts Institute of
      Technology (MIT) Auto-ID Laboratory, Capgemini Consulting, and the Intel
      Corporation.   In late 2018, seed funding was provided to initiate
      research into voice assistance technologies and potential standards, and
      to develop the Open Voice Network.</p>

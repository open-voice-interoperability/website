    description: >-
      The industry surrounding voice technology is at an inflection point. Innovation by voice tech experience strategists, designers, and developers has demonstrated tremendous potential to include and serve society at large, inclusive of many levels of literacy or physical and cognitive abilities. It has also raised questions about interoperability, ethical use, and standards to ensure voice tech is a trustworthy interface developed for the benefit of the many, as opposed to the few. Supporting the Open Voice Network’s work to recommend standards for interoperability and effective, ethical use of voice AI is vital  to growing the industry in a way that can offer society the full benefits of using speech to engage with the digital world.

  - author: Jon Stine | Executive Director of Open Voice Network
    quote: >-
      Enterprises that are active in standards development drive efficiencies,
      gain market access, and create competitive differentiation faster than
      those that don’t. From a market-share point of view, the question is
      whether you or your competitors will guide the future of the technology.

      Kees Jacobs | Vice-President for Global Consumer Products & Retail,
      Capgemini Consulting
    quote: >-
      Research indicates that three years from now, consumers will prefer using
      voice to other mediums for all interactions in the consumer products and
      retail sector, whether it is in store, in their cars or in their homes.
      But it is also clear that organizations should focus on gaining consumer
      trust. The Open Voice Network is the right initiative to help companies
      doing the right things, serving consumers in the right way.

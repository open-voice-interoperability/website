      Stanford Universityâ€™s Open Virtual Assistant Lab (OVAL) is a world-wide open-source initiative intended to confront three major challenges facing the future of this technology: avoiding fragmentation of the linguistic web, democratizing the power of natural language interfaces, and putting privacy back in the hands of consumers. They believe the breakout success of voice assistants is a testament to the power of natural language interfaces, but they see the potential of the linguistic web as being even bigger. OVAL envisions a future in which this potential is accessible, interoperable, and above all, worthy of our trust. For more information, please visit https://oval.cs.stanford.edu/.

  During these troubling times, can we trust the information our voice assistant
  is providing us? We find that voice is uniquely challenged in overcoming this
  obstacle.

Back in March, we were privileged to participate in [Dr. Teri Fisher's](https://voicefirsthealth.com/about/) superb and global webinar on the value of voice-first technologies amidst the pandemic.

Teri, applause and thank you. It was a great gathering of the community.

If you missed the webinar, you can find it on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LQHH0QHvss&feature=emb_title).

Here's a summary of the message from the Open Voice Network:

First, a caveat: the Open Voice Network, an industry non-profit dedicated to the development of long-needed standards for voice assistance, is not directly working on issues of COVID-19—but we stand in respect for those who are.

But we are addressing a related topic—one that has lingered long beneath the surface of voice assistance. One, that in these times, has risen to the surface.

## It's trust. User trust.

Trust that the information source they reach is the authentic and authoritative source. Trust that access is not controlled by third parties. Trust that the content is factual and accurate.

Trust that the information received points toward health and not elsewhere.

It's true that, in these times of ["Truth Decay"](https://openvoicenetwork.org/post/trust-in-the-time-of-covid-19-and-truth-decay/) (as the Rand Corporation so accurately describes it), all news, media, and content sites suffer from a lack of trust.

But voice—a relatively new technology, and a technology absent of global governing standards—is uniquely challenged.

## Uniquely challenged to be worthy of user trust.

Which is why we have formed the [Open Voice Network](https://openvoicenetwork.org/about/).

Toward a standards-based, trust-worthy future for voice assistance.

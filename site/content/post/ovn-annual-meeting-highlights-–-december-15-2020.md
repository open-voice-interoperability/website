Executive Director of the Open Voice Network Jon Stine addressed attendees with an in-depth look at the mission of the Open Voice Network. Stine reinforced the inclusive definition of “users” as those who seek to use voice for the creation of value. Individuals. Enterprises. Marketers. Designers. Developers. Strategists. Any and all who desire to utilize voice as a means to create value. The core message revolved around key concepts of user trust and the necessity of industry buy-in. With a registered mailing list of nearly 500, OVN is seeing the voice community come together to establish a combined effort for standardization. 

Other important topics included the ideas of interoperability (the standardization of component interfaces in voice assistants) and the creation of a voice registry system—a DNS for voice, where for example, a brand could be found by all, regardless of platform and mode. Work groups have been created for these topics (along with voice-specific privacy and security) to further align OVN’s mission and future body of work.

As the Open Voice Network looks ahead to 2021, a collaboration of OVN Communities and Ambassadors are working towards establishing OVN as an authority on  standards for voice assistance and user trust policies and methodologies. During the meeting milestone reports were provided by representatives of several OVN Communities.

* **Designer-Strategists:** _"In January, we will be formulating the work groups that contribute and also review the work that’s being created. This is an open call to come and join us and to help us shape \[OVN]— we need to continually push to make sure we have a global perspective.”_ - Susan Westwater, Designer-Strategists Community Co-Moderator

* **Ethical Use:** _"Toward the end of this year, we conducted a poll of our Ethical Use Community plus contributors and volunteers that we’ve interacted with throughout the year to determine priority areas for Quarter 1 of 2021...We’ve prioritized two key ethical use initiatives—those specifically being around privacy and inclusivity.”_ - Brooke Hawkins, Ethical Use Community Co-Moderator\
  <br>
* **Education:** _"The \[resources] that we have currently completed or just about completed are our lesson plans that will introduce children and teachers (for that matter, it can be parents as well] into the concept of voice assistance and how voice works. We have 6-8 lesson plans to introduce \[voice] at a young age for that development and understanding.”_ - Julie Davis, Education Community Moderator\
  <br>
* **Commerce:** _"We are focused on identifying the highest priority value propositions for voice in the commercial community...We are regularly gathering to talk about how does voice create value. We are introducing processes and frameworks to accelerate that conversation and elicit ideas that we can identify, document, propose, and then actually move into a work process of proofs of concept.”_ - Milan Turk, Commerce Community Co-Moderator

As the Open Voice Network works towards gaining a rubberstamp-level of trust and authority, Executive Director Jon Stine outlined a roadmap of 2021 goals:

* Revenue and sponsor growth
* Winning actionable mindshare
* Implementations of a voice registry system (VRS)
* First demonstrations of standards-based voice component interfaces
* Concept tests on solving and resolving commercial data ownership
* Privacy and security guidelines
* Guidelines in design from use cases

In closing, two important rhetorical questions were presented by Jon Stine to the global audience, along with a final call to action: 

1. What future do you want for voice?
2. Would you prefer to shape the future of voice or passively be shaped by it?

_If you prefer the former, the Open Voice Network is the place for you. Please join us._

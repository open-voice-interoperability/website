[Project Voice](https://projectvoice.ai/), the #1 event for voice tech and AI in America, has extended **The Open Voice Network** complimentary space and time within the 2021 gathering—with Friday, January 15th scheduled as the first **OVN Communities Summit**.

We're deeply grateful to Bradley Metrock and his team for his partnership. We anticipate that by this January we'll be ready to safely convene, discuss, and plan the future of standards-based voice assistance.

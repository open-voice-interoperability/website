As part of the Open Voice Network's commitment to exploring the value of voice technology in education, OVON's Education Steering Team (EST) Community has been hard at work creating a series of educational infographics for parents and educators who desire to use voice technology for educational purposes.

Led by OVON Ambassador and Community Moderator Julie Daniel Davis, the EST Community was created to research the use of conversational AI for educational purposes. The primary responsibility of the EST Community is to advise the entirety of the Open Voice Network on the why, the what, the how, and the legal requirements and ethical use of conversational AI for educational purposes.

The Open Voice Network encourages anyone who would like to learn more about the use of conversational AI for educational purposes to download, review, and share these infographics with educators in their community. The EST Community plans to create and release more infographics in the coming monthsâ€”check back soon to find even more graphics available for download.

If you are interested in learning more about OVON's work in the education sector, we encourage you to join the conversation. The Education Steering Team Community meets every other Wednesday at 15:30 Pacific. Visit our [calendar](https://openvoicenetwork.org/calendar/) to find the next event date and Zoom meeting link.

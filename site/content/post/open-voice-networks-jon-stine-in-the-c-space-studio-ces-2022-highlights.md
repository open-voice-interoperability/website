  We had an incredible time a few weeks ago at CES 2022 in Las Vegas! From the
  presentations and keynotes to education and networking, members from the Open

One of our favorite moments from the [CES 2022](https://www.ces.tech/) conference was our own Jon Stine having the opportunity to join host James Kotecki in the C Space Studio. Together the pair discussed the Open Voice Network's work in balancing the pillars of ethics with subjectivity, important questions to ask marketing and media leaders, and the driving force of data ownership in establishing standards for voice assistance.

> Voice standards are really about two thingsâ€”an economic structure and the use of data...As you are working with \[voice], how do you want your data and \[customers'] data to be used and respected? That's the core question. <br></br>

> \- Jon Stine, Executive Director of Open Voice Network

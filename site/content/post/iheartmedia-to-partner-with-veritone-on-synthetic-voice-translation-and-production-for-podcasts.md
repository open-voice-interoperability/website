Veritone's synthetic voice technology currently enables content creators, including actors, athletes, entertainment professionals, influencers, broadcast media outlets, and podcasters, to monetize and transform their verified synthetic voices into different languages with different accents, dialects, genders, and more.

Under this new collaboration, iHeartMedia—the world’s largest podcast publisher—will empower its most popular artists and creators to use Veritone's synthetic voice solution to transform their voices across multiple languages, vastly expanding their podcast market.

Ryan Steelberg, President of Veritone made a recent statement about the exciting news:

> "iHeartMedia has always been a pioneer of innovation, and now with the power of Veritone’s synthetic voice solution, iHeartMedia will not only be able to scale to new markets with localized language translations but retain the brand value of their top talent’s voice–which is fundamental in podcasting. We are also partnering to develop synthetic voices for advertising and engaging content while reducing time-to-market and production costs for radio, podcasting and the metaverse."<br></br>– Ryan Steelberg, President of Veritone, Inc.

iHeartMedia's podcast talents will now be able to solidify their brand and reach wider audiences by implementing Veritone's synthetic voice technology. Podcast hosts will have the ability to produce an episode, ad, or other related audio in multiple languages automatically without the need for additional studio time or translators, reaching listeners across the globe.

It's an exciting time for the world of voice, but with the rapid expansion and adoption of AI voice technology, the question continues to arise—**how do we ensure privacy and security needs are met?**

When it comes to synthetic voice and voice cloning, secure and ethical usage is a primary concern. Through the communal development and adoption of industry standards and usage guidelines, the Open Voice Network continues to advocate for both the growth of voice assistance and the need to create a safe, trustworthy experience for users and creators.

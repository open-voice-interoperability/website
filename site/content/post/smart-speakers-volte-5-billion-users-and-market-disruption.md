  What happens when 5B+ users jump to a new, easier method of engagement for
  brands and businesses? And what happens when there lacks a specific set of
  standards and safety nets? We may soon find out.

A [recently published study](https://www.juniperresearch.com/document-library/white-papers/how-will-5g-evolve-mobile-voice-in-an-ai-driven?utm_campaign=pr1_mobilevoice_providers_dec19&utm_source=businesswire&utm_medium=pr) by Juniper Research forecasts that the global number of VoLTE (voice over LTE) users will approach 5 billion by 2024 (up from 2 billion in 2019), driven in large part by the use of more than 220 million voice assistant-equipped smart speakers worldwide.

Two notable points from Juniper's press release:

* "Smart speakers, such as Amazon Echo and Google Nest, will enable new engagement channels which operators can offer to brands and enterprises. The research forecasts that the number of smart speaker voice minutes to phone numbers will grow over 1,000% over the next 5 years to represent 230 billion minutes of voice use globally by 2024."<br></br>
* "In addition, the research anticipates that VoLTE networks will be increasingly leveraged to direct mobile calls to smart speakers . . . users will link incoming traffic to both their smartphone and smart speakers simultaneously."

Hmm...

In such a scenario, might a DNS-like registry for voice destinations be critically important?

In such a scenario, might standards on such issues as user identification and authentication, [data privacy](https://openvoicenetwork.org/post/the-issues-of-voice-and-privacy-go-well-beyond-data-security/), and interoperability also be important?

Might the communal development and delivery of standards accelerate conversational AI toward its full potential for consumers and enterprises alike?

**We happen to think so.**

We're the [Open Voice Network](https://openvoicenetwork.org/about/). Dedicated to bringing the value of standards to the exciting new world of voice. #OVN

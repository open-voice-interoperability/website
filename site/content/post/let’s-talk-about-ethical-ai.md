  Analyses of voice data already allow conclusions about age, weight, height,
  origin, level of education, positive or negative mood, the truthfulness of
  what is said, and even the speaker's state of health—including indications of
  diseases such as cancer or even COVID-19. Although it might sound like science
  fiction, these findings from voice analysis are already a reality.

One of the most comprehensive carriers of information is the human voice.

According to experts, Artificial Intelligence (AI) will…

* Reach the level of human performance before the end of this decade
* Be available to everyone as open-source algorithms and tools in the cloud
* Enable building new businesses at a fraction of current costs

It's clear that technology is playing a greater role in our everyday lives. Artificial intelligence has the potential to massively impact the way we live, work, and play. Ethical AI is a concept that has been gaining momentum as more voice experts, thought leaders, and informed consumers are recognizing its potential for disruption if not carefully implemented. In order to ensure that the growth of AI is ethical and socially responsible, we need to be having more conversations on the topic.

During a particularly insightful online event held on 17 November, five experts in the industry came together to discuss the opportunities, challenges, and ethics of Artificial Intelligence. 

Hosted by Deutsche Telekom, a [Sponsoring Member](https://openvoicenetwork.org/sponsoring_member/) of the Open Voice Network, Moderator Malte Clavin led the discussion, along with industry experts Angelika Pauer of PwC and Leuphana University, Bernhard Hochstätter of Deutsche Telekom, Mirko Saul of Schwarz Digital, and OVON’s Executive Director Jon Stine. The event not only allowed space for thought-provoking conversation, but it also gave the audience a better understanding of the topic and raised awareness of its importance.

The emergence of AI has been one of the most significant developments in our lifetime. This is largely due to its ability to solve problems that have long been considered impossible for machines to tackle. However, with this innovation comes a unique set of risks and challenges. In order to help mitigate these risks, Deutsche Telekom has defined a framework for AI usage within their company, using these nine self-binding guidelines. Per their framework, artificial intelligence usage must be:

1. Responsible
2. Careful
3. Supporting
4. Transparent
5. Secure
6. Reliable
7. Trustworthy
8. Cooperative
9. Illustrative

As more and more companies utilize AI within their business, it’s important to keep these discussions around its ethical usage at the top of mind. The Open Voice Network believes that one of the most important components of the solution is for thought leaders in the industry to continue to come together and have open dialogues on the issues at hand.

AI has been a key topic of discussion for many years now, and it's inevitable that it will shape our future—but it's clear there are still hurdles we must overcome when it comes to its ethical usage. In the coming years, the AI industry will continue to grow, and the more we can educate ourselves on its potential and its limits, the better we can make it work for us.

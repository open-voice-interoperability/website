The Open Voice Network is excited to attend and participate in this year's [ViVE event](https://www.viveevent.com/) in Miami Beach, Florida. Focused on the business of healthcare systems, this technology event merges the leadership of the [College of Healthcare Information Management Executives (CHIME)](https://chimecentral.org/) and with the digital marketplace of [HLTH](https://www.hlth.com/). With 4,000+ attendees and 250+ speakers, ViVE 2022 is bringing together top thought leaders in the industry to discover what the most innovative minds in healthcare can create together.

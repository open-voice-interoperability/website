At the Open Voice Network, Tobias Martens (founder of [Who Else AI](https://www.whoelse.ai/)) is a key member of our Interoperability Initiative. This [initiative](https://openvoicenetwork.org/initiatives/) is led by the OVON Architecture Work Group, and the core question they work towards answering is how might voice agents of different platforms or technical parentage share dialogs, data, context, and controls. 

Hear from Tobias as he interviews with Kane Simms, host of the [VUX World Podcast](https://vux.world/podcast/), about the ongoing work towards interoperability, the development of an open voice protocol that is open source, privacy-based, and built upon public industry standards, and what all Who Else AI is working on to make it a reality.

## We're funded, chartered, and up and running

The Open Voice Network is now up and at work, exploring the technical standards and ethical frameworks that will make conversational AI worthy of user trust—and reach its remarkable potential in our digital world.

## What are we working toward?

The standards needed by a voice industry that’s in its early days. Standards needed for tens of billions of users, and thousands, even millions of independent enterprise voice assistants. A world in which every AI is conversational. Standards that enable choice, accessibility, and openness. Standards that grow the market.

## Who's now in the Open Voice Network?

More than 150 enterprise users and top-tier voice practitioners, from 12 nations and five continents, meeting regularly in Work Groups and Communities—each addressing specific questions and taking on critical development tasks. 

## What's happening now?

* The **OVN Architecture Work Group** is now reviewing voice assistant architectures from around the world, seeking to identify common components and interfaces. Opportunities for standardization? Where and how will commercial firms innovate and create differentiation?
* **The OVN Privacy and Security Work Group** is now exploring voice-specific issues of consumer and commercial privacy. There are clearly rights to respect; there may also be values to support and promote. How?
* Now forming: an **OVN Work Group** to envision and research the possibility of a **Global Voice Registry—a DNS for voice destinations.** Needed in a billion-end point world? Many think so. How to do it? The big challenge. Our Community of voice developers has been building a list of requirements. Join the conversation!
* Also now at work: OVN Communities of **Designers & Strategists** (focused on enterprise use cases), **Ethical Use** (issues of privacy, consent, and inclusivity), **Educators** (a teacher's field guide to voice, ever-more important in these days of remote students), and **Commerce** (the how-what-where of retail and brand voice value).

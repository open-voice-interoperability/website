The question of AI-voice in commerce is not whether, but **when**. 

Which means those entrusted with retail and CPG brand performance are now figuring out the **where, how,** and **why** of this increasingly important technology.

**Meet Amir Tsrouya**.

He's the co-founder and CEO of [**Tukuoro**](http://tukuoro.com/), a voice open platform company based in Tel Aviv. The company's name means "speaker" in Maori. Their value proposition is simple: they seek to make every digital interaction voice enabled, in any language, on any platform, and in any use case. They do so through context-driven speech recognition and processing—which, in layman's terms, means that Tukuoro doesn't need a large data set for AI learning or the needed to acquire it.

Since Tukuoro's founding in 2015, he and his colleagues have been working in multiple vertical industries, including (with some very prominent customers) extensive work in retail.

Why voice? Why voice in commerce?

## **Voice: the natural interface in today's world of data**

For Amir, it began with an insightful question: in this world of IOT and exponentially growing knowledge, **how will humans interface with data and data platforms?**

For greatest ease? Greatest efficiency?

"It was clear to us that voice represented a huge leap forward in the interface," Amir said. "If we wanted to get deeper in the ways we interact with data, well, voice was the natural thing."

And it's a natural thing for commerce.

As Amir talks with retailers and consumer-facing enterprises in Europe, the United States, and in Israel, one thing has become clear from his conversations: every brand is searching for ways to deliver a better customer experience. 

"Whether we're talking to government agencies, banks, insurance agencies, or even the people who run ticketing machines for public transportation—everyone's customers are expecting a better experience, and a better _service experience_ across the board.

"A voice interface is right now one of the best ways for any brand to disrupt, to make things easy for customers." 

Although developing a voice interface is no easy task, Amir makes the case that using Tukuoro may bring a much faster return than other investments currently on a CIO's list.

## But there is a worry—it's called p-r-i-v-a-c-y

As the technology evolves, voice interfaces will sound much more natural, and as they sound much more natural, they'll become much more popular.

As they become much more popular, they'll access more and more data. Commercial and PII. This is a major concern to Amir and his Tukuoro team. 

"We must learn to harness this technology," he said. "You know, it's been the dominant thinking that we have to give away our PII and business data in order to obtain decent AI-voice service and access."

"But it should be possible to provide a superior experience for consumers in voice without giving away personal and commercial information. And that is our approach. The experience needs to be very superior. And very **private** for both the consumer and brand."

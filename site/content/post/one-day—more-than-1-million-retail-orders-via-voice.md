If you've ever wondered about the feasibility of AI-voice and commerce, consider the role of Alibaba's AliGenie voice assistant during last year's Singles Day, the [11-11 Global Shopping Festival](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/11/alibaba-singles-day-2019-record-sales-on-biggest-shopping-day.html).

According to China retailing savant David Roth, CEO of [The Store WPP EMEA](https://thestore.wpp.com/about-us) and Asia, more than one million orders to Alibaba were placed and paid for through AliGenie this past November 11th.

And, it was wonderfully easy. Shoppers said "I want \_\_\_\__" to AliGenie, and AliGenie (which is resident on more than 250 million devices) provided recommendations from some 900 voice-believing brands. Payment was executed immediately and securely through Alipay.

**One million orders by voice. Communicated, confirmed, and paid.**

Voice is the easiest way for a shopper to say **YES**. And clearly a valuable part of 24 hours for Alibaba that delivered revenues in excess of $38.3 billion USD.

Voice and commerce.

With more than one million reasons consumer-facing enterprises need the global voice destination, data privacy, identification, and interoperability standards envisioned by the [Open Voice Network](https://openvoicenetwork.org/about/).

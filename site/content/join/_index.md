      Jon Stine | Executive Director of Open Voice Network
    quote: >-
      Enterprises that are active in standards development drive efficiencies, gain market access, and create competitive differentiation faster than those that donâ€™t. From a market-share point of view, the question is whether you or your competitors will guide the future of the technology.

      Kees Jacobs | Vice-President for Global Consumer Products & Retail,
      Capgemini Consulting
    quote: >-
      Research indicates that three years from now, consumers will prefer using
      voice to other mediums for all interactions in the consumer products and
      retail sector, whether it is in store, in their cars or in their homes.
      But it is also clear that organizations should focus on gaining consumer
      trust. The Open Voice Network is the right initiative to help companies
      doing the right things, serving consumers in the right way.

      The industry surrounding voice technology is at an inflection point.
      Innovation by voice tech experience strategists, designers, and developers
      has demonstrated tremendous potential to include and serve society at
      large, inclusive of many levels of literacy or physical and cognitive
      abilities. It has also raised questions about interoperability, ethical
      use, and standards to ensure voice tech is a trustworthy interface
      developed for the benefit of the many, as opposed to the few. Supporting
      the Open Voice Network’s work to recommend standards for interoperability
      and effective, ethical use of voice AI is vital  to growing the industry
      in a way that can offer society the full benefits of using speech to
      engage with the digital world.     <br><br> Opportunities to get involved
      within the Open Voice Network are open to individuals willing to give of
      their time, network, industry knowledge, and resources through
      collaboration, advocacy, and development of standards. Enterprises are
      invited to join the Open Voice Network as Sponsoring Members by providing

    quote: >-
      Research indicates that three years from now, consumers will prefer using
      voice to other mediums for all interactions in the consumer products and
      retail sector, whether it is in store, in their cars or in their homes.
      But it is also clear that organizations should focus on gaining consumer
      trust. The Open Voice Network is the right initiative to help companies
      doing the right things, serving consumers in the right way.

    description: >-
      The industry surrounding voice technology is at an inflection point. Innovation by voice tech experience strategists, designers, and developers has demonstrated tremendous potential to include and serve society at large, inclusive of many levels of literacy or physical and cognitive abilities. It has also raised questions about interoperability, ethical use, and standards to ensure voice tech is a trustworthy interface developed for the benefit of the many, as opposed to the few. Supporting the Open Voice Networkâ€™s work to recommend standards for interoperability and effective, ethical use of voice AI is vital  to growing the industry in a way that can offer society the full benefits of using speech to engage with the digital world.

    quote: >-
      Research indicates that three years from now, consumers will prefer using
      voice to other mediums for all interactions in the consumer products and
      retail sector, whether it is in store, in their cars or in their homes.
      But it is also clear that organizations should focus on gaining consumer
      trust. The Open Voice Network is the right initiative to help companies
      doing the right things, serving consumers in the right way.

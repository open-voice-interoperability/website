    quote: >-
      Research indicates that three years from now, consumers will prefer using
      voice to other mediums for all interactions in the consumer products and
      retail sector, whether it is in store, in their cars or in their homes.
      But it is also clear that organizations should focus on gaining consumer
      trust. The Open Voice Network is the right initiative to help companies
      doing the right things, serving consumers in the right way.

      <p>Voice as a digital interface and platform promises to make digital
      connections easier and more inclusive worldwide, to create value for
      businesses and organizations of all types. Unfortunately, the path to that
      promise is not assured.</p>

      <p>The Open Voice Network was formed to enable voice assistance to fulfill
      its promise.</p>

      <p><strong>The Open Voice Network is a collaborative industry initiative
      that will develop and propose global industry standards for voice
      assistance.</strong> Such standards will make voice assistance worthy of
      user trust across multiple platforms, devices, and use cases worldwide,
      and like other standards-development efforts, substantially accelerate the
      growth of the available market.</p>
    heading: What is the Open Voice Network?
  - answer: >-
      <p>Voice assistance has the potential to become a primary touchless way to
      connect more quickly and easily with the internet, smart homes and
      factories, and enterprise applications. For consumer-facing industries,
      voice assistance could improve productivity, profitability, accessibility,
      and inclusion. But what started as the world’s fastest adopted consumer
      technology may fall well short of its potential for acceptance and value.
      Consumers are showing increased hesitation to venture into new usage, and
      enterprise decision-makers are concerned about issues of data ownership
      and use. Research points to a “trust gap” that raises critical questions
      of <strong>privacy, ease of use, dependable connection, equal and unbiased
      access, and data security.</strong></p>

      <p>These concerns extend beyond the handful of organizations dominating
      the voice assistance landscape today. Leading industry analysts predict
      that as voice assistance grows in availability and adoption, thousands of
      innovators and Tier 1 businesses will introduce their own independent and
      branded assistants by 2025. In such an environment, questions of
      invocation, interoperability, commercial data ownership, and security
      become paramount.</p>
    heading: Why is this organization important?
  - answer: >-
      <p><strong>There is an absence of standards in the world of voice
      assistance.</strong> At present, there is no communally developed, broadly
      adopted “rule of law” that governs voice assistance. Issues such as
      privacy, data use, access to third party sites and applications,
      interoperability and the like are managed at a commercial platform level.
      As in the earliest days of the internet, this absence of standards leads
      to concerns and a lack of trust among individual users, enterprise
      decision-makers, and the developer-designer-strategist community – which,
      in turn, is now leading to an increasing gap between assistant
      availability, adoption, and regular use.</p>
    heading: Why are standards needed in voice assistance?
  - answer: >-
      <p>We believe that a major part of the solution lies in the
      <strong>communal development of broadly endorsed and implemented
      standards.</strong> In other technological and industrial situations,
      standards have created component interoperability – enabling the creation
      of purpose-built solutions, and the growth of firms whose innovation can
      create a “special sauce” to one or more components. Standards also push
      investment toward the development of new capabilities and features; they
      spark the creation of developer tools; and, for enterprise users, they
      deliver a “build once, use many” efficiency, as the need for proprietary
      interfaces diminishes.</p>

    heading: Who is involved in the Open Voice Network?
  - answer: >-
      <p>The Open Voice Network is independently funded and governed by a
      Steering Committee of executives from sponsoring enterprises. The Open
      Voice Network is a Directed Fund of The Linux Foundation (LF) and benefits

      <p>In 2020-21, the Open Voice Network will be working with enterprises,
      voice practitioners, platform providers, and industry associations in
      <strong>North America and the European Union.</strong> The Open Voice
      Network has also formed a working collaboration relationship with the
